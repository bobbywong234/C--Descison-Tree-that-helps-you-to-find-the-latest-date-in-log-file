# Csharp&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic&nbsp;Search&nbsp;that&nbsp;helps&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;find&nbsp;the&nbsp;latest&nbsp;date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;log&nbsp;file

This is using Csharp to build up the tokenizer and weigth algorithm that can find latest date time. 

Please note that this is the simply algorithm, a programmer need also develop the streampipe to collection data from HTTP Curl and Json files.
Because the data collection method could be varied in different situation, so that's why I din't code for all possible situation could happend in specific scenario.
