# Csharp&nbsp;&nbsp;Descison&nbsp;Tree&nbsp;that&nbsp;helps&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;find&nbsp;the&nbsp;latest&nbsp;date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;log&nbsp;file

This is using Csharp to build up the algorithm that can find latest date time. In fact, it can aslo applied to find the shortest path when you applied to 2d array as X and Y are the coordinate, and array can be scaned by either Y axis or X axis.


Please note that this is the simply algorithm, a programmer need also develop the streampipe to collection data into the array cantainer.
Because the data collection method could be varied in different situation, so that's why I din't code for all possible situation could happend in specific scenario.
